# Ising-Model-2D

In order for this code to work add the header file (olcPixelGameEngine.h) found at https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.
<br /> <br />

The Energy (E=...) and Magnetization (M=...) are printed out continuously. <br />

Commands one can use so far:

* **Left Click (Hold)** &rarr; Changing a 10 x 10 block of spins to value 1 (White).  <br />
* **Right Click (Hold)** &rarr; Changing a 10 x 10 block of spins to value -1 (Black).  <br />

* **I Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Resets the entire grid and all variables. <br /> <br />

* **H Button (Hold)** +  **UP Button (Pressed)** / **DOWN Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Increasing / Decreasing the value of the magnetic field. <br /> 
* **J Button (Hold)** +  **UP Button (Pressed)** / **DOWN Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Increasing / Decreasing the coupling constant J. <br /> 
* **T Button (Hold)** +  **UP Button (Pressed)** / **DOWN Button (Pressed)**&rarr; Increasing / Decreasing the temperature. <br /> <br /> 

* **H Button (Hold)** +  **ENTER (Pressed)** &rarr; Setting H to its original value. <br /> 
* **J Button (Hold)** +  **ENTER (Pressed)** &rarr; Setting J to its original value. <br /> 
* **T Button (Hold)** +  **ENTER (Pressed)** &rarr; Setting the Temperature to its original value. <br /> 

* **H Button (Held)** +  **F Button (Pressed)** &rarr; Entering a seperated canvas to increaase/ decrease the magnetic field in specific regions. <br /> 
-> * **Left Click (Hold)** &rarr; Increasing magnetic field.
-> * **Right Click (Hold)** &rarr; Decreasing magnetic field.
